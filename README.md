# Fun Poker Program 
---------------------------------------------
          FIXME:
- need to implement working "U" Undo function

---------------------------------------------
          NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS:
- add chips calculations? not sure if useful yet. - some done - not useable yet
- after so many hands, single out users with very high play percentages in a category and indicate player type

---------------------------------------------
          FUTURE IMPROVMENT IDEAS:
- add input for hand combinations along with suggestions based on my playstyle graph and a compilation of pro graphs.
- Could track playstyle and give suggestions.
- Give suggestions based on the playstyles of others at the table.
- Give suggestions based on a chosen playstyle: Aggro, conservative, Precision, etc...
  
- Create a better visual to better visualize the table and actions.
- create audible or visual way of input control

- keep records of tournaments/sit and go wins and losses along with placement posisition and possibly info for last 3-5 hands.
- take inputs for people left in multi table setting, give recomendations based on current variables
- keep track of BB multiplier, especially convenient for multi table
- keep track of BB and give advice based on that with ratio of BB multiplier

- keep long term records of stats and give recomendations based on them.
- create records and profiles for players you play against often, will help remember their playstyle
